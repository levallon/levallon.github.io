  content : "Everyday, including weekends, two teams of two volunteers relay one another to help our salaried employees. The first team, from 2pm to 6pm, welcomes residents and takes part to the good running of the hotel (answering phone calls,...). The second team, from 6pm to 9pm, organizes and serves the dinner (if the sanitary conditions allow us to keep the restaurant opened).<br><br>
  Volunteers can also propose occasional activities for residents and memebers of the association: music, cooking foie gras, floral decoration, pastry, photo exhibition, traditional 'Galette des Rois', sophrology,...<br><br>
  Volunteers make themselves available twice a month.<br><br>
  If you want to volunteer, call us (+33 5 61 55 44 92) or e-mail us (secretaire.levallon@orange.fr)."
